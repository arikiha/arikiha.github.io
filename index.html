    <h1> Moments With Her </h1>
    <h3> _________by Ikramul </h3>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>
  I don't know girls, but boys, When they fell in love, they keep remembered every single moment with her or watching on her.
  </br>
I also still remember the first time when I fall on her we're childrens, in her house. It was her birthday party. I was with one of my elder sisters who brought a magic lady cartoon doll as a gift for her, and she really loved it. I also remember she gave me a piece of cake on a white little ceramic plate with a fork spoon by her hand. From That age, she was very tidy, while her little brother was very vile. Her brother used to jump on the bed and make it raunchy to irritate her because she didn't like it to be messy. That day one of her friends, I mean male friend, gifted her a red-balloon that was exactly heart shaped, not Love-heart but the real-heart shaped. And she liked it a little, which made me jealous for the first time that day. 
  </br></br>
We also used to play badminton in a ground near her home when I visited there. When she played against me, she always won because my focus was always on her, not the game. She was so beautiful that her picture might burn my phone. She also liked cycling. And I helped her to climb a hilly road and then came back speedily to the bottom together, with me sitting behind her on the cycle. But one day, one of her neighbor friends came with a new cycle, which was obviously attractive. Everyone was talking to him, including her. This made me very jealous and sad. Thoughts started to come. She might not be mine! The next day, I didn't go to play with her. She also came to call me but I didn't go. 
  </br></br>
Another day, many months or a year later, both of us were in my paternal uncle‚Äôs home. She stepped out of the bath, her hair dripping with water, smelling of a sweet and soothing fragrance. I was really lost in her admiring beauty as if I had seen an angel.  I wanted to be with her, keep watching and talking to her, So as an excuse I asked her to show me how to play a puzzle game. While she was busy showing me how to play the game, I was just lost in her lips which were like ripe cherries, tempting and juicy. They curved into a smile that melted my heart. I was just looking at her, which was healing the whole of my body.
  </br></br>
As we grew older, the gap between us widened. We rarely see each other across the chasm. This happens once in a Blue üåö moon.
  </br>
   Actually, on ceremonies and Eids.But whenever we meet, I record every moment with her in my mind, using my pair of eyes in a million frames per second rate. But growing up made me shy, I cant even start a conversation or speak softly or keep eye contact with her. Whenever we meet, only she starts the conversation, also which lasts not so long as I feel uncomfortable to talk to her publicly. which she may think I'm ignoring her or have no feelings for her.
  But I have feelings for her and also feel jealous whenever someone else stares at her or she talks to someone else too much. As she is an angel-looking girl, many boys obviously stare at her, which makes me crooked. Also, not so long ago, at an event, a random boy was asking her little brother for her number, which made me crooked as usual.
  </br></br>
  Just like these and those, I remember every and every moment and event when we met. I also remember one day she asked if I would like to eat fried dal and gave me some from her hand, which was the second time I ate something from her hand. Also I've counted each of the 14 dals. 
  </br></br>
As for the moments, I also remember all of her dress codes, earrings, rings and necklaces. I remember everything from her hair and face to her legs. I remember everything about her where I was present. I remember all her faces with makeup and without makeup. I also keep collecting her photos. Her beauty can't be expressed in words, but she is the most beautiful girl in the world, and I loved her with all my heart.She is really a fascinating girl on whom any color will surely fit. But silver-blue and light green makes her more fascinating. I never knew angels lived on earth until I saw her in a light green dress in one of her photos, where her red-white ears were like delicate shells, wearing a pair of earrings that had two square plates making a star shape with some diamond-cut stones. Her fingers are like long, pure white feathers, with long-shaped nails . Her hair is like a cascade of black silk, flowing over her shoulders and down her back.
  </br></br>
The thing I loved the most about her is her pair of eyes. She had the most mesmerizing eyes I had ever seen. They were long and almond-shaped, tempting and alluring me with their sweetness and depth. They sparkled with a light that melted my heart with every look she gave me. Her pair of eyes had a depth of mystery and wisdom that could fill a thousand pages of poetry and prose. I could write a whole epic only from the description of them.
  </br></br>

One day, I decided to send her a message and tell her how I feel. I typed a long text, expressing all my feelings and memories. Hoping that she would reply and say that she loves me too, that she would agree to meet me and talk to me, we could start a relationship and be happy together. I was about to press the send button but my thoughts stopped me.
  </br></br>
I thought that she might not reply at all. She might ignore my message or block my number. She might have someone else in her life or not be interested in me. She might be angry or hurt by my confession. She might think that I'm crazy or desperate. She might reject me or break my heart.
  </br>
I didn't know what would happen next. I didn't know if she would ever love me back. I didn't know if we would ever be together. I didn't know if we would ever have a future.
  </br></br>
But I knew one thing for sure. I knew that I loved her with all my heart. I knew that I would always love her, no matter what. I knew that she was the most beautiful and wonderful girl in the world. I knew that she was an angel came to the earth to make me <b>"Besotted"</b>. I knew that she was the only one for me.
  </br></br>
And I hope that she know that too.
